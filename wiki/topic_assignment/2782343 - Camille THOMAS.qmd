(K) "In line with the proposition of media effects theories that each adolescent may have a unique susceptibility to the effects of social media, a viable explanation for the small and inconsistent findings in earlier studies may be that the effect of social media differs from adolescent to adolescent."

(A) The main argument of this paragraph is the difference in outcome between the numerous studies on the mobile phone among adolescents. Indeed, most of the studies were not based on each teenager but on a whole adolescent population, which was controversial because each individual and especially each teenager to his sensitivity.

(R) most of the studies done on the mobile phone related to problems caused by the phone: digital health, depression, excessive use, isolation... here, in this study, the researchers wanted to focus on the individual aspect of the phone. For a teenager, his mobile phone is precious. They usually contain his greatest secrets. For the researchers in this study, we cannot do a study on the mobile phone with young people by making the results of collective research. This notion of mobile phone heterogeneity is not a good way to find answers about benefits or harms. in this research, the notion of individuality is really present. The researchers agreed to make the results very individualistic, which makes it possible to better understand the various disorders that adolescents may suffer when using the telephone and to better understand the well-being of teenagers.
